# _Word Definer for Kidz_

#### _G-rated Urban Dictionary_

#### By _**Nick Ramsey**_

## Description

_For my second Ruby code review, I am building an application that allows users to enter and define their own words. Once a word is created, users can retrieve a list of words and edit/delete words or their definitions. Check us out on <a href="https://frozen-tundra-93129.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>!_
